Here is the promp used with curosr AI to create the existing framework.

I'm building a Tamagotchi Leaderboard app in React Native with Expo for my biomedical engineering capstone.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Users can create and care for a virtual Tamagotchi pet
- The app tracks pet stats over time and displays a competitive leaderboard
- Real-time updates when other users interact with their pets

TECH STACK:
- React Native (Expo)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database + authentication)
- Supabase Real-time subscriptions (live updates)
- React Navigation (routing)
- TypeScript for type safety

DATA MODEL:

Users table (managed by Supabase Auth):
- id (UUID - auto from auth.uid())
- username (string, unique)
- email (string, unique)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

Tamagotchis table:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
- name (string)
- health (integer, 0-100)
- hunger (integer, 0-100)
- happiness (integer, 0-100)
- avatar (emoji or string)
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_interaction_time (timestamp)
- total_interactions_this_week (integer)
- is_alive (boolean)

Leaderboard view (or query results):
- Ranks pets by total_interactions_this_week
- Includes pet name, owner username, interactions, avatar
- Scoped to current week

CORE FEATURES:

1. Authentication Screen
- Sign up with email/password using Supabase Auth
- Login with email/password using Supabase Auth
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Navigation to home after successful authentication
- Session persistence using Supabase Auth state

2. Home Screen
- Display user's Tamagotchi (if exists)
- Show pet name, avatar, and current stats (health, hunger, happiness)
- Stats displayed as progress bars with percentages
- Three action buttons: Feed, Play, Sleep
- Real-time updates when stats change

3. Stat Change Logic
- Feed button: hunger -30, happiness +10, health +5
- Play button: hunger -20, happiness +30, health -5
- Sleep button: hunger -10, health +50, happiness +50
- All stats clamped between 0-100
- Each action increments total_interactions_this_week
- Updates last_interaction_time to current time
- Immediately update Supabase after each action
- Handle optimistic updates for better UX

4. Pet Creation Screen
- If user has no pet, show screen to create one
- Text input for pet name
- Simple avatar picker (use emojis: 🐢 🦎 🐉 🦜)
- Create button saves to Supabase
- Navigate to home screen after creation

5. Leaderboard Screen
- Display top 10 pets ranked by total_interactions_this_week this week
- Each entry shows: rank, pet name, owner username, total interactions, pet avatar
- Real-time updates using Supabase real-time subscriptions (onSnapshot equivalent)
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Empty state message if no pets exist
- Uses Supabase query with order by and limit

6. Settings Screen
- Display current username
- Option to change username (with input, validation, update in users table)
- Option to rename Tamagotchi (update in tamagotchis table)
- Sign out button with confirmation dialog (Supabase signOut)
- Back button to home screen

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use modern, clean UI (no skeuomorphism)
- Stats should have visual progress bars (health=red/green gradient, hunger=orange, happiness=yellow)
- Buttons should be large and easy to tap
- Color scheme: use teal/blue as primary, with accent colors for stats
- Responsive layout (works on phones and tablets)
- Dark mode support (if device has dark mode enabled)
- All text should be readable (good contrast)

SUPABASE SETUP:
- Initialize Supabase client with credentials from .env
- Set up Supabase Authentication (email/password provider)
- Create PostgreSQL tables (users, tamagotchis, leaderboard view)
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
  - Users can read/write their own user profile
  - Users can create their own tamagotchi
  - Users can read/write their own tamagotchi
  - Users can read all tamagotchis (for leaderboard)
  - Prevent unauthorized writes to other users' data
- Enable real-time subscriptions for tamagotchis table
- Create database function to reset weekly interaction counts (optional: via cron job)

CUSTOM HOOKS:
- useAuth: Handle sign up, login, logout, auth state
- useTamagotchi: Fetch and manage user's pet, real-time updates
- useLeaderboard: Fetch top 10 pets, real-time leaderboard updates
- useTamagotchiActions: Handle feed, play, sleep logic with Supabase updates

ERROR HANDLING:
- Network error handling (show offline message if no internet)
- Invalid input validation (empty username, invalid email)
- Supabase errors (auth failures, write failures) with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation (leaderboard still works if one pet fails to load)
- Handle real-time subscription errors

NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:
- Use React Navigation (stack + bottom tabs)
- Tabs: Home, Leaderboard, Settings
- Auth stack for login/signup (conditional based on session)
- Conditional rendering based on auth state

PERFORMANCE:
- Lazy load images/avatars
- Optimize Supabase queries (only fetch top 10 for leaderboard, use select() to limit columns)
- Use memoization for heavy components
- Cache user data locally with AsyncStorage
- Use real-time subscriptions efficiently (unsubscribe on unmount)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Set up Supabase project and get credentials
2. Create database tables and RLS policies
3. Generate complete project structure
4. Create config/supabase.ts with client initialization
5. Create all screens (Auth, Home, Leaderboard, Settings, PetCreation)
6. Create custom hooks (useAuth, useTamagotchi, useLeaderboard, useTamagotchiActions)
7. Set up navigation with React Navigation
8. Add TypeScript types for all data models
9. Include error handling and loading states throughout
10. Test real-time updates with multiple users

Please generate production-ready code with:
- Full TypeScript support
- Proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Comments explaining complex logic
- Following React Native best practices
- All files organized in a logical folder structure
- Supabase row-level security policies
- Real-time subscription management
